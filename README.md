# BallGame
This project is a simple game created with Python.

The ball on top of the screen is created at random positions and the player on the bottom of the screen needs to catch the ball. Difficulty of game increases in terms of ball speed every 10 balls caught.

This neat and clean game design I learned from Eric Matthes book called Python Crash Course which I highly recommend. Check out https://github.com/ehmatthes for further information.

In my opinion creating even simple games can improve your programming skills since there is a lot of issues that needs to be solved in order for game to work.
